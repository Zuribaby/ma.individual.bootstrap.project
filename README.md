Individual Capstone Project
Your capstone project is to rebuild the Home Page of the website https://melsoft.co.za/

Tip: Use a full Bootstrap Template and customise it according to your preferences.

Not only will you gain practical experience in HTML, CSS & Bootstrap, but having this project under your portfolio will open doors for your career and make you stand out in the job market.

Once youâ€™re done, please upload your website to GitHub Pages and share the link with your mentor and your cohort members for suggestions to improve.

Happy coding!
